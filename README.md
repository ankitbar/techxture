An app for classifying foods based on texture instead of taste for people with ARFID and related issues

Sure! Hereâ€™s a high-level architecture for an application that classifies food images based on texture using Python. This architecture outlines the major components and their interactions.

### High-Level Architecture (WIP)

#### 1. **User Interface (UI) Layer**
   - **Web or Mobile App**: A front-end interface where users can upload food images.
     - Technologies: Flask/Django (for web), or Kivy/React Native (for mobile).
   - **Features**: 
     - Image upload functionality.
     - Display results and confidence scores.
     - User feedback option (to improve model).

#### 2. **Backend Layer**
   - **API Server**: Handles requests from the UI and processes image classification.
     - Technologies: Flask or FastAPI (for RESTful APIs).
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `/upload`: Accepts image uploads and returns classification results.
     - `/feedback`: Accepts user feedback to improve the model.

#### 3. **Image Processing Module**
   - **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare images for model input.
     - Resizing, normalization, and texture extraction (using libraries like OpenCV or PIL).
   - **Texture Analysis**: Extract texture features from images (e.g., Gabor filters, Local Binary Patterns).
     - Use libraries such as scikit-image or OpenCV for feature extraction.

#### 4. **Model Layer**
   - **Machine Learning Model**:
     - **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate model for texture classification (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)).
     - **Framework**: Use TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch for model training and inference.
   - **Training Pipeline**:
     - Collect and preprocess a labeled dataset of food images with corresponding texture labels.
     - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
     - Train the model, evaluate, and tune hyperparameters.

#### 5. **Database Layer**
   - **Data Storage**: Store images, labels, and user feedback.
     - Technologies: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for structured data storage.
   - **Model Artifacts**: Save trained model weights and configurations.
   - **User Data**: Store user profiles, image upload history, and feedback.

#### 6. **Feedback Loop**
   - **Model Improvement**: Collect user feedback and new images for retraining the model.
   - **Periodic Retraining**: Set up a pipeline to periodically update the model with new data.
   - Technologies: Use tools like Apache Airflow for workflow management.

#### 7. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - **Deployment**: Use Docker to containerize the application for easier deployment.
   - **Cloud Service**: Host the application on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
   - **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track application performance and user interactions (e.g., using Prometheus or Grafana).

### Flow of Operations

1. **User Uploads Image**: The user uploads an image of food via the UI.
2. **Image Preprocessing**: The backend processes the image to extract relevant features.
3. **Model Prediction**: The processed image is passed to the machine learning model for classification.
4. **Result Display**: The classification result and confidence score are sent back to the UI and displayed to the user.
5. **User Feedback**: Users can provide feedback on the classification, which is stored in the database for future model improvement.
6. **Model Retraining**: Periodically, new data and feedback are used to retrain the model to improve accuracy.
